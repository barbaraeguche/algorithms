## arrays
a linear type of data structure that stores values.

### dynamic arrays
- allocation of new memory when an array is filled happens in `amortized` time, i.e.: **$O(1)$**

### time complexities
- access: **$O(1)$**
- insertion/deletion at `end`: **$O(1)$**
- insertion/deletion at `middle`: **$O(n)$**
