## linked list (both singly and doubly)
a type of data structure in which the previous and/or next pointers refer to the preceding or following nodes, respectively.

### time complexities
- access/search: **$O(n)$**
- insertion/deletion: **$O(1)$** if you have reference to the node at the desired position else **$O(n)$**
