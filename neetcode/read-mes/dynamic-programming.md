## dynamic programming
simply put, it is an optimized version of recursion. it takes a big problem and solves it by breaking it down into 
smaller problems. the reason we say it is optimized recursion is because it is often more optimal when it comes to time 
and space.

### types of dps
- **top-down (memoization)**: traverse the tree from the root and go down all the way to the base cases.
- **bottom-up (tabulation)**: computes the result of the base cases first and then works its way up.

### time complexities
- 1-dimension: **$O(n)$**
- 2-dimension: **$O(n * m)$**
