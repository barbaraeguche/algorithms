## insertion sort
this type of sorting algorithm works well when the dataset to be sorted has values ***within a specific range.***

it is not a stable sorting technique, i.e. the order of elements do not stay the same if the comparing keys are equal
in value. this is because we are overwriting the original array.

### time complexities
- loops through the entire array: **O(n)**

### space complexities
- sorting happens in-place: **O(n)**
