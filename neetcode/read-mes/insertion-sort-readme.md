## insertion sort
a sorting technique that loops through the entire array to sort out-of-place numbers by looping back until the right position of said number is found.

a stable sorting technique, i.e. the order of elements stays the same if the comparing keys are equal in value.

### time complexities
- when an array is already sorted, the time complexity: **Î©(n)**
- when an array is not sorted, the time complexity: **O(n)**

### space complexities
- sorting happens in-place: **O(1)**
